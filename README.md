# Crypton
A simple Dart library for asymmetric encryption and digital signatures

> This library is a simplified interface to interact with the [pointy castle](https://pub.dev/packages/pointycastle)

For symmetric encryption and hashing I strongly recommend to use [steel_crypt](https://pub.dev/packages/steel_crypt).
